This repository contains shiny web application code files, ui.R and server.R.

I have developed a shiny web application that can predict the next word given your text input. Shiny app is rather useful for demonstrating how the text prediction model works.

You can reach and play with this simple text prediction model at [my_app](https://davutemrah.shinyapps.io/my_app_Next_Word/)
